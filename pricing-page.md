## Introduction

Welcome to my freelance AI consulting services. With extensive experience in AIOps, DevOps, and open-source object storage solutions, I offer a range of consulting services designed to help you leverage AI technologies effectively and securely. My expertise is backed by several impactful publications and hands-on projects in the AI and DevOps space.

## Consulting Services and Pricing

Below is a detailed breakdown of my consulting services and pricing models. These rates are designed to reflect the value and expertise I bring to your projects.

### Hourly Rate Calculation

To ensure transparent and fair pricing, my hourly consulting rate is derived from a full-time salary equivalent of $150,000 per year. Here's how the calculation is done:

- **Annual Salary**: $150,000
- **Work Weeks per Year**: 52
- **Hours per Week**: 40
- **Total Work Hours per Year**: 52 * 40 = 2080 hours

**Base Hourly Rate**:
- $150,000 / 2080 hours ≈ $72 per hour

**Consulting Premium**:
Consultants typically charge 2-3 times the base rate to cover business expenses, taxes, benefits, and the value of their expertise. Using a multiplier of 2.5:

**Consulting Hourly Rate**:
- $72 * 2.5 ≈ $180 per hour

### Pricing Models

I offer flexible pricing models to meet your specific needs, whether you require one-time consulting or ongoing support.
