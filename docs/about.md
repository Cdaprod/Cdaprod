# About Me

I'm David Cannan, a passionate autodidactic Software Engineer and AI Developer based in Douglasville, Georgia. With a background that blends self-taught software engineering skills and professional experience at companies like MinIO, I focus on building scalable, AI-driven solutions. As a single father to triplets, I balance my professional ambitions with my role as a dedicated parent, embodying resilience and perseverance in both my personal and professional life.
