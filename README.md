As a MinIO DevOps and an aspiring tech innovator, I'm deeply engaged in building personal AI solutions using the OpenAI API, Python LangChain Framework, and Mistral LLM via LM Studios. My journey into the tech world is self-taught, rooted in a passion for hacking, software engineering, DevOps, programming, cloud technologies, containerization, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Software as a Service (SaaS), cybersecurity, and bug bounty hunting. Overcoming addiction, I've reshaped my life to focus on being a dedicated single father to my triplet boys, embodying resilience and determination.

Currently, I'm honing my skills as a DevOps Intern at MinIO, where I'm writing [articles](https://blog.min.io/author/david-cannan) and gaining invaluable hands-on experience with cutting-edge cloud storage technologies. My ambition is to establish a strong personal brand as a self-made success in the tech field. I'm particularly interested in projects that offer financial potential, including software development for web apps, digital downloads, custom bots, and data lake applications with machine learning capabilities.

My approach to projects is to seek streamlined, structured development guidance for app modules, aiming for efficiency and effectiveness in my work. My social media presence, including this GitHub, [Twitter](https://x.com/cdasmktcda), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cdasmkt), and my [blog](https://Sanity.Cdaprod.dev), reflects my journey and interests. Living in Douglasville, Georgia, USA, I'm an advocate for sharing my experiences and insights with the tech community, using hashtags like #devopsdad, #codenewbie, #tripletdad, and #hacktheplanet to connect with like-minded individuals.

My methodology, emphasizes being *extra* and overly technical, breaking down tasks into subtasks, prioritizing them, and executing them in sequences. This structured approach helps me tackle complex problems systematically. In coding requests, I prefer detailed, logical responses with necessary imports and logic, and I'm open to using tools like Mermaid.js for class diagrams.

My tech stack includes CI/CD with GitHub Actions (Cdaprod/), Docker Registry (hub.docker Cdaprod/), and Container Registry (Ghcr.io Cdaprod/), reflecting my commitment to using leading-edge technologies in my projects. Through the LangChain API (LCEL), I utilize LLMs, tools, and classes for API and data integration, enhancing my capabilities in developing innovative solutions.

With a goal to generate passive income, I'm keen on outlining key development steps for quick project setup and execution, always looking for ways to leverage my skills for financial and professional growth.
