As a cabinet maker, I have always admired the beauty of hardwood grain, each piece a testament to natureâ€™s craftsmanship. But the mystery of what lay beneath the surface always intrigued me, leaving my creative mind searching for more. Similarly, as a portrait photographer, the exposure triangle and its precise calculations fascinated me, allowing me to capture perfect exposures.

These creative pursuits deeply resonated with me, often leaving me to wonder where I might be if innovation had played a bigger role in my work. Engineering and writing software, while different, offer a unique kind of control. As a software engineer, I have the power to shape and mold every detail of my creations, much like working with wood or capturing an image. When my creativity is at its peak, I can envision every layer of grain and calculate the perfect exposure, mapping out projects from scratch in my mind.
